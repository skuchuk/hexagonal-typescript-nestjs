    // example of using environment variables to override configuration variables

    // if process.env.PORT has a value in it OR
    // if process.env.DB_SCHEMA has a value in it
    // this value will override the configuration value in all other config files (default, production. qa)

    // it is also possible to impose an expected format to the environment variable value and config library
    // would try to parse it as such
